                                    <b>LaRena</b> 
                                    is a queer California native who grew up in the 90’s obsessed with all that teen angst 
                                    on the WB. From Roswell to Buffy to Dawson’s Creek, she watched it all. When she grew 
                                    up she did what most people dream of and ran away to the circus for eight years. 
                                    LaRena can currently be found adulting in NYC as a software engineer, professional 
                                    Ravenclaw, nerd trivia champion, and avid theatre goer.

                                    is a dog mom, Jazz Fest enthusiast, and Walt Disney World aficionado. She is a proud 
                                    supporter of the arts in her adopted hometown of New Orleans, LA. Her hobbies include 
                                    attending community theatre, hosting cabaret nights, and anything that involves costumes. 
                                    Lisa strongly recommends that everyone experience Mardi Gras in New Orleans at least once 
                                    (she promises it’s totally family-friendly). Although she’s a baby of the late 80s, 
                                    Lisa somehow missed out on all the teen drama series that aired during her middle and 
                                    high school years. She can’t quite remember what she was doing at the time—probably hanging 
                                    out in AIM chat rooms or practicing for her Bat Mitzvah—but she’s excited to finally dive 
                                    in to the wonderful world of Roswell.

                                    is a proud Jewish woman living in Massachusetts and loving all of the teen sci-fi that the 
                                    world has to offer. When she is not watching Roswell, she can also be found working with 
                                    youth on the Autism spectrum, geeking out on languages (she speaks four), and helping 
                                    spread fat positivity and body-posi vibes to everyone. Aliza has been a fan of Roswell 
                                    since it originally aired and is pleased to be sharing that love with new and long-time

                                    She is a Social Worker by day but in her time off she enjoys traveling and going to 
                                    live concerts and music festivals. While Buffy remains her favorite show, she is also 
                                    a huge fan of shows like Wynonna Earp, Veronica Mars, Stranger Things, and Parks and 
                                    Recreation. She somehow missed Roswell in its prime, but is so excited to be taking
